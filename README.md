# A-prototype-localization-robotic-system-using-the-Dijkstra-algorithm.


This project aims to design and implement a prototype robotic system that intends to assist firefighters in accomplishing their duties, including navigation, rescue, and obtaining localization information. By adopting the  Dijkstra algorithm, the system will be able to navigate through the fastest route inside the building where GPS signals are inaccessible.
